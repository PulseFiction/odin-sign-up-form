## As part of the odin project Intermediate HTML and CSS course

Tasked with creating a sign up form using information learned from previous lessons such as HTML form validation and styling.
The general layout of the form was taken from a template image that the course provides for the project, consisting of the left sidebar with the title
and logo on top a transparent banner; with the form to the right of it.

Things I used to create this:

* SVGs - The bull SVG logo for the form was one of the first SVGs I've used, obtained from a free icon bundle, it lead to the name of the imaginary company: Matador.
* Flex - Flex was used to layout the entire webpage
* Mobile first design - Wasn't actually required for the project criteria, however I enjoy using this principle when designing webpages as it is easier to design the desktop version after.
